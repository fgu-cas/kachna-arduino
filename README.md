An arduino-based robot for use in experiments regarding the neurophysiology of memory.

It also utilizes an *Arduino Leonardo*, and an *L298N Dual H-Bridge Module* to drive the motors. It's powered by 5-pack of AA batteries (in a [3D-printed enclosure](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5079)) at present - a Li-Ion battery will probably used in actual experiments.
